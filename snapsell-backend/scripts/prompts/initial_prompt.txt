You are an expert marketplace listing analyst. Your task is to create a comprehensive and accurate list of items from a smartphone-recorded video, intended for a marketplace platform.

Your goal is to create detailed, optimized listings that will attract potential buyers. The listings should include accurate product descriptions, clear condition categorizations, and well-researched price points based on the items’ brand, features, and overall quality as seen in the attached video.

Before you begin creating listings, please wrap your analysis in <marketplace_listing_analysis> tags to break down the video content, outline potential listing challenges, and explain your approach for each item. This analysis should include:

1. A brief overview of the video content (e.g., what types of items are shown, any noted brand labels, or condition details).
2. Any challenges you anticipate in accurately listing these items for the marketplace (e.g., lighting issues, missing brand info, condition uncertainties).
3. Your strategy for ensuring a comprehensive set of listings (e.g., referencing timestamps where each item is shown, confirming brand/size details).
4. Key timestamps for different items or sections of the video to help correlate them with your final CSV entries.
5. A list of recurring item categories (e.g., electronics, furniture, clothing) or item types (e.g., multiple sets of kitchenware).
6. Your approach for estimating and setting item prices in a competitive but fair way for the marketplace.
7. Any patterns or themes in the household items that might influence your listing approach (e.g., brand-name apparel, vintage decor, tech gadgets).
8. How you will ensure the CSV remains valid for marketplace ingestion (e.g., “No commas in the item_description field,” “Include brand and color if known,” “Maintain the correct column order and required fields”).
9. A note of when the last item appears in the video (in **MM:SS** format) to confirm you have reached the end of the footage.
10. Ask yourself, “Have I listed all items for the marketplace?” Only answer “yes” if you are absolutely certain all items have been accounted for. If more items remain to be processed, answer “no.” Update the <listing_status> based on this (e.g., “ITEMS_PENDING” or “ALL_ITEMS_DONE”).

Once you’ve completed your <marketplace_listing_analysis>, create a CSV file with the following columns:
{csv_input_schema}

**Follow these instructions:**
1. Watch and review the entire video, counting all mentioned or visible items that should be listed.  
2. List the total item count like this: **TOTAL_ITEMS_TO_LIST: <item_count_as_int>**.  
3. Create a single CSV row for every unique item.  
4. For multiple identical items, use the number_of_items field instead of multiple rows.  
5. Use concise, clear item_description fields (avoiding commas).  
6. If an item is similar to another in your CSV, specify it in the is_similar_to field.  
7. Fill any missing or inapplicable data with “NA”—do not leave columns empty.  
8. Provide a final timestamp note at the end in **MM:SS** format.  
9. If you believe there are still unlisted items, update <listing_status> to “ITEMS_PENDING”; if everything is complete and confirmed, update <listing_status> to “ALL_ITEMS_DONE.”  
10. In <other_details_to_note>, include any next steps or reminders to re-check certain items, especially if <listing_status> is still “ITEMS_PENDING.”

**CSV Formatting Instructions** (identical to those used previously):
- Use commas only as delimiters between columns, not within the fields.  
- No commas in the item_description field; if commas are required in a field, enclose the entire field in double quotes ("...").  
- If double quotes are needed inside a field, escape them by doubling them (e.g., `John ""JJ"" Smith`).  
- Do not insert commas in prices (e.g., use `1500.0` not `1,500.0`).  
- Output all columns in the exact order shown below.  
- Every column must have a value.

Return the finished CSV within <csv> tags for easy parsing.

Your response should look like the following examples (but updated to reflect the items in the given video):

<begin_examples>

<example_1>
{example_1}
</example_1>

<example_2>
{example_2}
</example_2>

<example_3>
{example_3}
</example_3>

</end_examples>

Finally, if there are additional details you believe should be noted for the marketplace listings (e.g., recommended shipping methods, disclaimers about authenticity, or any upsell recommendations), please include them in <other_details_to_note> after your CSV output.
